### Psalm 140 - keyboard arrangement

A setting made for a [keyboard instrument](./Psalm-140.ly).
Chords and their first and second inversions are played with right hand, bass - with left hand.

### Psalm 140 - arrangement for 4 voices

The same psalm written for [4 voiced choir:](<./Psalm-140 4st.ly>) soprano, alto, tenor and bass.
Why settings for 4 voices are interesting? 
They could be easily played on an organ, but a musician might - and might not play chords and their inversions with right hand, 
and the bass - with left as such notation enables more decouplings, for example:
 - soprano and alto played with right hand on a manual 2;
 - while the left left hand plays tenor on manual 1;
 - and the bass is played either with left hand on manual 1 or with bass pedal.

Also, the voices can be re-arranged so that any voice is leading a "cantus firmus" (a chant): tenor, alto or bass.
