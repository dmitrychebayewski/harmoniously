In this example I have written two arrangements using Bert Matter's "numbering". 

### Chords versus Choral

When exploring the possibilities of Lilypond, I got almost same results 
for [Psalm 140](https://www.liedboekcompendium.nl/lied/140-bescherm-mij-heer-behoed-mijn-leven-1_4_0)
with chords and cholral arrangements using Bert Matter's numbering for the "narrow position".

Why is making choice **Chords versus Choral** important?
In my opinion, there is no answer to be your definitive guide forever, but there are a few helpful choice criteria.
- If your focus is keyboard mastery (Chords, sequences, figures), please check this audio (Chiel-Jan Hofwegen, Liedboek 2013)[https://kerkliedwiki.nl/images/b/bd/Psalm_140%2C_Chiel_Jan_van_Hofwegen.mp3] and focus primariliy on the chords.
- If you are overwhealmed with choral polyphony, please check this audio [Hervormde Cantorij Culemborg o.l.v. Bert Lassing; Marco bij de Vaate, orgel](https://www.liedboekcompendium.nl/lied/140-bescherm-mij-heer-behoed-mijn-leven-1_4_0) and focus  on engraving each voice individually: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.

### Psalm 140 - keyboard arrangement (chords)

A setting made for a [keyboard instrument](./Psalm-140.ly).
Chords and their first and second inversions are played with right hand, bass - with left hand.

### Psalm 140 - arrangement for 4 voices (choral)

The same psalm written for [4 voiced choir:](<./Psalm-140 4st.ly>) soprano, alto, tenor and bass.

### Conclusion: Why are settings for 4 voices interesting? 
They could be easily played on an organ, and are very flexible and versatile, for example:
 - soprano and alto played with right hand on a manual 2 (or vice versa, left hand playing alt and soprano on a manual 2);
 - while the left left hand plays tenor on manual 1 (vice versa: right hand playing tenor on manual 1);
 - and the bass is played on bass pedal (optionally combined with tenor, right hand if one cannot play pedal).

Also, the voices can be re-arranged so that any voice is leading a "cantus firmus" (the basis forming a chant): tenor, alto or bass.
