### Psalm 140 - keyboard arrangement

A setting made for a [keyboard instrument](./Psalm-140.ly).
Chords and their first and second inversions are played with right hand, bass - with left hand.

### Psalm 140 - arrangement for 4 voices

The same psalm written for [4 voiced choir:](./Psalm-140 4st) soprano, alto, tenor and bass.
Why settings for 4 voices are interesting? 
They could easily played on an organ, but one shouldn't play chords and their inversions with right hand, 
and the bass - with left.

This notation enables more decouplings:
 - soprano and alto with right hand, manual 2;
 - left hand - tenor, manual 1;
 - bass - either lefgt hand, manual 1 or bass pedal.

Also, the voices can be re-arranged so that "cantus firmus" (a tune) is led by tenor, alto or bass.
