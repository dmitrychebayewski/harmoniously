# Harmoniously
Why especially Bert Matter's and Peter Molenaar's "In goede harmonie" and Stephen Taylor's 
["The Lost Chord"](https://www.stephentaylor.nl/) methods are so interesting for a beginning keyboardist?

As an organist, it is quite a common practice to use "Liedboek. Zingen en bidden in huis en kerk" during a Dutch Calvinist Liturgy.
The "Liedbook" songbook doesn't have choral settings for soprano, alto, tenor and bass, just a staff with a melody.

It is good to know how to apply the right chords properly, and how to trivially improvise over a soprano melody that the "Liedboek" provides.

Fortunately for an organist, old (Renaissance) music, that Genevan psalms are,
is fine for interpreting as series of triad chords (C major, G major) and their first and second inversions,
played in a proper rhythm.

This repository is intended as collection of settings for Genevan psalms, created with lilypond.
Please fork the repository and use the sheet music if you find it interesting!

## Enge ligging (narrow position)
Narrow position is one of the methods how to build a chord properly.

In a "narrow position" the space between soprano (the highest pitch) and bass (the lowest) is filled with alto and tenor
so that no space is actually left between soprano, alto and tenor for one more note from the triad to be used.
